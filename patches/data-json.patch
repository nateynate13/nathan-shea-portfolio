Our analysis focused on profitability, liquidity, efficiency, and solvency metrics, while also identifying operational risks related to streaming, ESG compliance, and healthcare cost exposure. To contextualize Disney's financial health, we used Comcast/NBCUniversal as a benchmark across key ratios. We synthesized this research into an investor-oriented thesis, recommending Disney as a long-term investment based on its post-COVID rebound, diversified revenue streams, low debt load, and future-forward strategy in both digital content and physical expansion.",

       "summary": "More than two thousand years ago, the Greek city-states, led by Athens and Sparta, laid the foundation for much of modern science, the arts, politics, and law. But the influence of the Greeks did not end with the rise and fall of this classical civilization. As historian Roderick Beaton illustrates, over three millennia Greek speakers produced a series of civilizations that were rooted in southeastern Europe but again and again ranged widely across the globe. In The Greeks, Beaton traces this history from the Bronze Age Mycenaeans who built powerful fortresses at home and strong trade routes abroad, to the dramatic Eurasian conquests of Alexander the Great, to the pious Byzantines who sought to export Christianity worldwide, to today’s Greek diaspora, which flourishes on five continents. The product of decades of research, this is the story of the Greeks and their global impact told as never before.",
       "rating": 4.5,
       "review": "I felt like I owed it to myself to brush up on the incredible history of Greece, and wow was Beaton's work dense and comprehensive. I feel like the Greek's influence on modern life as we know it is widely recognized, and yet the scale of that influence is so much more widespread than we give it credit for. From the alphabet to foundations of modern societal structure, they sort of came up with everything. As I write this post my semester abroad, it's amazing to reflect back on the feelings of intellectual legacy I felt while in naturally beautiful Greece."

       "rating": 5,
       "review": "To me, as a life long NBA fan and self proclaimed 'ball-knower,' watching Nikola Jokic play basketball is almost a religious experience. The way he moves so fluidly, always makes the right play, and only looks to score when his absolutely needs him to, and the fact that he treats being the best player in the NBA like his day job! It's safe to say that I'm obsessed. I even traveled solo to Belgrade to watch some Serbian Euroleauge hoops. This book was just a fun read. You realize how great of a human being Nikola Jokic, and it just adds to his legacy in my eyes. What a guy!"
