To contextualize Disney's financial health, we used Comcast/NBCUniversal as a benchmark across key ratios.

      "summary": "More than two thousand years ago, the Greek city-states, led by Athens and Sparta, laid the foundation for much of modern science, the arts, politics, and law. But the influence of the Greeks did not end with the rise and fall of this classical civilization. As historian Roderick Beaton illustrates, over three millennia Greek speakers produced a series of civilizations that were rooted in southeastern Europe but again and again ranged widely across the globe. In The Greeks, Beaton traces this history from the Bronze Age Mycenaeans who built powerful fortresses at home and strong trade routes abroad, to the dramatic Eurasian conquests of Alexander the Great, to the pious Byzantines who sought to export Christianity worldwide, to today’s Greek diaspora, which flourishes on five continents. The product of decades of research, this is the story of the Greeks and their global impact told as never before.",
      "rating": 4.5,
      "review": "I felt like I owed it to myself to brush up on the incredible history of Greece, and wow was Beaton's work dense and comprehensive. I feel like the Greek's influence on modern life as we know it is widely recognized, and yet the scale of that influence is so much more widespread than we give it credit for. From the alphabet to foundations of modern societal structure, they sort of came up with everything. As I write this post my semester abroad, it's amazing to reflect back on the feelings of intellectual legacy I felt while in naturally beautiful Greece."

Filled with exclusive, sure-to-be-headline-making interviews, including unique insights from Jokic himself, Why So Serious? delves deep into the soul of the mysterious center and reveals how the big man developed his relentless work ethic, exceptional court vision, and magical playing style that has redefined dominance in the NBA.",
      "rating": 5,
      "review": "To me, as a life long NBA fan and self proclaimed 'ball-knower,' watching Nikola Jokic play basketball is almost a religious experience. The way he moves so fluidly, always makes the right play, and only looks to score when his absolutely needs him to, and the fact that he treats being the best player in the NBA like his day job! It's safe to say that I'm obsessed. I even traveled solo to Belgrade to watch some Serbian Euroleauge hoops. This book was just a fun read. You realize how great of a human being Nikola Jokic is, and it just adds to his legacy in my eyes. What a guy!"

When he was twelve, Matar and his family went into political exile. Eight years later Matar's father, a former diplomat and military man turned brave political dissident, was kidnapped from the streets of Cairo by the Libyan government and is believed to have been held in the regime's most notorious prison.",
      "rating": 5,
      "review": "I chose to read this book because, quite frankley I knew nothing about Libya as a country, its history or Qaddafi. This book is incredible. The way it combines investigative journalism with philosophical reckoning of father son relationships makes it one of a kind. I was blown away by the comprehensive history of Libya that it gave, and even more blown away by Matar's story and the generational courage that him and has family has shown through oppression and constant threat. Highly recommend. It's also a quick read."

      "summary": "When the Rosens moved to New Rochelle in 1973, Jonathan Rosen and Michael Laudor became inseparable. Both children of college professors, the boys were best friends and keen competitors, and, when they both got into Yale University, seemed set to join the American meritocratic elite. Michael blazed through college in three years, graduating summa cum laude and landing a top-flight consulting job. But all wasn’t as it seemed. One day, Jonathan received the call: Michael had suffered a serious psychotic break and was in the locked ward of a psychiatric hospital. Diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, Michael was still battling delusions when he traded his halfway house for Yale Law School. Featured in The New York Times as a role model genius, he sold a memoir, with film rights to Ron Howard. But then Michael, in the grip of an unshakeable paranoid fantasy, stabbed his girlfriend Carrie to death and became a front-page story of an entirely different sort. Tender, funny, and harrowing by turns, The Best Minds is Jonathan Rosen’s magnificent and heartbreaking account of good intentions and tragic outcomes whose significance will echo widely.",
      "rating": 5,
      "review": "A memoir that combines investigative journalism into the history of mental health research and public sentiment with personal reckoning of growing up in affluent New Rochelle in the 1960s, Yale Law school, and two best friends. This book made me cry. I learned from The Best Minds how brilliance and promise can unravel under the weight of mental illness and societal pressure, revealing the thin line between genius and tragedy. I loved it because it blended intellectual depth with raw humanity—showing how even the most gifted lives are shaped by forces beyond logic or control."
